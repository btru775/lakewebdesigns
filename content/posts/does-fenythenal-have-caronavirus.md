## Feyntanly and caronavirus?

What if some people getting sick were blow heads? Could fentanyl laced coke have corona virus. I really don't think smuggler are worried about having infected product over money. The government wouldn't be able to stop that anymore than have already. There might be a little bit less on the streets but smugglers are pretty good at figuring out what they need to do to meet there demands. Just a suggestions what do you think?
