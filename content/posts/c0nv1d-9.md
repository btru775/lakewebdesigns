## Trump Quote Generator 

I recently started studying Golang. I created my first Golang website, 

 from scratch and launched it. The site is still a work in progress, needs basic stuff like certs and domain but WTH.

The site is 100% GO and Docker which is really cool. You have to refresh it but every time you do and random quote or saying from Donald Trump will emerge. I don't mean to offend but if you are offended then this is not for you!:)
