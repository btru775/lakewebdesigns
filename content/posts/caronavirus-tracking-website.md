## Caronavirus Tracking Website

I published a Carona-Virus Tracking website. The website is made out of Javascript. I recently remove the graph because of data but the rest of the app is still running beautifully. I made it a little more colorful the the usual doom and gloom. The reason I made this is just because I though WTH.
