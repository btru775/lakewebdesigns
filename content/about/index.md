Coding is pimp. I am from Lake Tahoe, been coding since a young 'n 

with blazing speeds of 28.8k modems.

I remember those days. I fist put together a website with angel fire and used HTML Tables to fit a structured website on Netscape!!

I been at this for a while and also add my expertise and life experience into the mix.

I used to think I had swag. Little did I know the journey that coding would end up taking me through. I started with just a few HTML tags here and there to new what I would consider essential knowledge in today's IOT's world. Everything from front end HTML CSS to JavaScript, Back-end JavaScript, Python, Django, Docker, and Go formerly Golang.

I'm basically a doctor of internet things now. I also have been working professionally in IT for a few years now and learned a shit ton of basic CPU, data-basing, networking, server maintenance, and all the boring stuff too.

I put this portfolio together to be able to create a platform to show how I solve things. Check out my projects and post for more of what I do.
